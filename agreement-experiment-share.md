# Agreement → Experiment → Share (AES) Model

The **Agreement → Experiment → Share (AES)** model is a lightweight reflection cycle that helps us operate as a **learning organization**. It’s not extra work — it’s a way to learn *through* our work, improve outcomes for students, and build shared understanding across teams.

- **Agreement** – Clarify what we’re trying to learn or improve and how it connects to our institutional context. Build shared understanding and psychological safety around inquiry.
- **Experiment** – Run a small, time-boxed test to generate learning. Focus on evidence and signals, not perfection.
- **Share** – Communicate what we learned (including surprises) so others can adapt or build on it. This creates healthy feedback loops.

> The AES cycle supports continuous improvement and aligns with Foundational Themes: **Equity, Feedback Loops, Culture, Data** (avoid possessive forms of UAGC).

## Why AES?
- **Practical:** Works with real constraints — small tests, quick loops.  
- **Collective:** Turns individual learning into team and institutional learning.  
- **Aligned:** Keeps work connected to student success goals and strategic priorities.

## How It Looks in Practice

<details>
  <summary><strong>Agreement →</strong> get clear together</summary>

**Aim (question):** *How might we increase the clarity and accessibility of faculty resources used during onboarding?*  
**Context:** Mixed audience (staff + faculty). Connects to Student Success Drivers (Communication & Connection; Institutional Structure & Environment) and Organizational Key Result (Quality Online Education).

**We agree on:**
- The problem/opportunity we’re exploring  
- Who’s affected and how we’ll know it’s better  
- Where this fits among institutional priorities
</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Experiment →</strong> learn with a small test</summary>

**Design a small, time-boxed test:**
- **Action:** Tag 10 key resources and improve captions for 3 videos.  
- **Observe (signals):** Time to find resources; faculty feedback; caption error rate.  
- **Learn:** If searchability and clarity improve, roll the pattern to the full library.

*Tip:* Experiments should be small enough to run in **1–2 weeks**.
</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Share →</strong> build the learning loop</summary>

**Share:** 1-slide update or short post with:  
- What we tried  
- What we saw (evidence)  
- What we learned  
- What we’ll do next (and who might reuse this)

Sharing closes the loop and helps others not start from zero.

## Reflection Prompts (use in the agent or your worksheet)

- **Agreement**
  - What outcome or experience are we trying to improve? For whom?
  - Which student success goals/drivers or strategic objectives relate?
  - What’s *in scope* for a first pass?

- **Experiment**
  - What’s the smallest change that would produce a useful signal?
  - What will we observe? How will we interpret the result?
  - What’s the time box (days/weeks)?

- **Share**
  - Who needs to know and why?
  - What is the single most important insight?
  - What will we recommend next (continue, scale, pivot, stop)?

## Example Alignment Statements (High / Medium / Low)

These sample sentences help calibrate the agent’s tone and specificity.

**High Alignment (clear, direct, central)**
- *Quality Online Education:* “Improving caption accuracy directly elevates the quality and inclusivity of online learning materials.”  
- *Communication & Connection:* “Clear, searchable resources reduce friction and increase faculty engagement with guidance.”

**Medium Alignment (related, enabling)**
- *IT / Data:* “Tagging resources and tracking usage creates signals we can use to guide improvements.”  
- *Employee Voice & Communication:* “Collecting quick feedback from users strengthens internal communication loops.”

**Low Alignment (indirect, peripheral)**
- *Workforce Partnerships:* “Improved internal resources could later support employer-facing materials but are not the immediate focus of this work.”

## Foundational Themes — Quick Questions

- **Equity:** Who benefits, and who might be left out? What barrier did we reduce?  
- **Feedback Loops:** What feedback did we gather? How did it change our next step?  
- **Culture:** How did we practice Communicate / Advocate / Respect / Empower / Student-Centered?  
- **Data:** What signals or evidence informed a decision (and what’s missing)?

---

## Using AES in the Exploring Alignment Agent

- Start with: **your role, your aims, and a short description of current work**.  
- The agent will surface **High / Medium / Low** alignments and propose **small experiments**.  
- Ask for help writing a brief **share-out** (1 slide or short post) — close the loop.
