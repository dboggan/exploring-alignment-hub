## Student Success Drivers
UAGC uses a student-centered approach to organize work that supports the three Critical Student Success Goals: **Retention**, **Completion**, and **Value.**

In addition to these drivers, all work should demonstrate four **Foundational Themes:** *Equity, Feedback Loops, Culture,* and *Data.*  
These themes are not standalone categories but should be evident in every project, initiative, and experiment.

Work may align clearly to a Student Success Driver, but users should also consider how foundational themes strengthen their efforts.  
The agent uses these drivers to check alignment and may reference foundational themes when relevant.
